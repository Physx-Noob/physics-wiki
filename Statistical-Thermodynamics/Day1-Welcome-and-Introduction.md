### Problems in Thermodynamics:
Solution of Thermodynamic Problems can be broken down into two great tasks:
- developing rules for macroscopic behaviour ad-hoc or numerically
- providing microscopic information is subject of microscopic thermodynamics

### Goals of Thermodynamics:
- Identify Process
- Set control mass, volume or any other parameter
- sketch diagrams defining how phases change for the system under study
- Obtain necessary properties like $T, p, V, m, S, G, F, U$ etc
- calulate interactions
- 1st law of thermodynamics - energy conservation
- put together all system of non-linear algebraic equations and solve them
- second law of themodynamics to find efficiency of cycles

### What is Energy?
$$F = ma$$
$$W_{12} = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} F \cdot dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} ma \cdot dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} m \frac{dV}{dt} \cdot dx = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} mV dV$$
$$W_{12} = \frac{1}{2} m ( V_2^2 - V_1^2)$$
From where does the potential energy arise?
$$F_z -W_z = ma_z$$
$$W_{12} - mg(z_2 - z_1)= \frac{1}{2} m ( V_2^2 - V_1^2)$$

$$W_{12} = \Delta PE + \Delta KE $$

$$E = PE + KE$$
#### What is Internal Energy??
$$U = \sum_n PE + \sum_n KE$$
Total energy of system given macroscopic and microscopic particles is:
$$E = PE + KE + U$$
### Thermodynamic Properties
- Properties are quantities that describe the state of the system.
- CD: position, rotational orientation, velocity, momentum etc
- T: temperature, entropy, energy, volume, pressure, no of moles of different constituents etc 
- Extensive and another is intensive
- $U, V, N_i$ - extensive
- $T, p$ - intensive
### Limitations of Thermomdynamics
#### 4 Types of Thermodynamical Problem
- Initial/ Final state Problems
- Specified interaction problem
- Limiting Process Problem
- Cycle analysis

#### The BIG Problem of Thermodynamics
- It only works for equilibrium states
