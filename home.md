# Welcome to Physics Wiki
I wanted a site which will help me learn Physics the way I learnt programming. Learning programming has become so easy. There are a lot of tutorials on the web, in the form of blogs, tutorial series videos and much more. Sadly, for Physics no such proper resources exist other than the series of Youtube Playlists uploaded by a few kind people. This is the initiative to fulfil that dream.
